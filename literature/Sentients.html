              Here lies his future grave <br />
              A 3D space where there is nothing but air<br /><br />

              He waited so many days until they turn into decades<br />
              he have seen stars change their trajectory<br />
              structures build, went down and got built again<br />
              he have seen bubbles turning into ice crystals<br />
              murals and glyphs lost and discovered again<br /><br />

              He saw species evolve, adjust and mutilate<br />
              Genocides broke down and peasants decapitate<br />
              He saw pirate fleets and filthy bags of jutes<br />
              He saw sewer rats and Frenchmen with boots<br />
              Truths turn into myths as they determine destiny<br />
              Fates shaped as baits and brought down agony<br />
              People enforce people and think it was harmony<br /><br />

              He lived for so many days<br />
              that he was named -'The elder god'<br />
              He have seen carbon units turn into wax dolls<br />
              He saw banners wave in pride and sieged walls<br />
              He saw schools of tiny fishes<br />
              demolishing chains and mines underwater<br />
              He saw People selling balloons<br />
              and black and white mimes trying to stutter<br /><br />

              He have seen prostitutes feeding decaying children<br />
              he have seen calendars end but written again<br />
              He saw dead whales turn into feeding grounds of enemies<br />
              He saw colliding pulsars in the cosmos<br />
              He saw people getting wise then getting clever<br />
              He saw Isles shatter while Cthulhu and tumatauenga fights<br />
              he saw men forgetting names of festivals<br />
              He have seen people love with rising empathy<br />
              he have seen people die as they fail to define time<br />
              He saw tents of warriors and temples of monks<br />
              He saw all of this but acted like he saw none<br /><br />

              Maybe someone asked<br />
              How long will you keep living?<br />
              Hasnt it been enough miseries and salvations?<br />
              He replied - maybe. And he whispered<br />
              - let tomorrow be excellent. Because He is we.<br />
